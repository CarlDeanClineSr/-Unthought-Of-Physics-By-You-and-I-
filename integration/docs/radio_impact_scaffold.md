# RADIO_IMPACT Capsule Scaffold

---

## Capsule Title: RADIO_IMPACT

### Overview
This scaffold is intended for the development and documentation of the RADIO_IMPACT capsule. The capsule centers on the mechanisms and theoretical underpinnings of radio impact, its experimental frameworks, and possible unrecognized effects in physical systems.

### Purpose and Scope
* To outline the theoretical foundations of radio impact in novel physical regimes.
* To provide a template for documenting observed phenomena and experimental methodologies.
* To serve as a living document for updates and community-contributed insights.
