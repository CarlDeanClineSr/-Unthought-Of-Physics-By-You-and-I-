# Teaching Capsule #002 – CME Shock Event (Dec 10, 2025)

## Capsule Metadata

- **ID:** TC-002
- **Date Created:** 2025-12-11
- **Event Date:** 2025-12-10
- **Status:** Active
- **Category:** Solar Wind Events - CME Shock Detection

## Event Summary

On December 10, 2025, the LUFT v0.7.0 intake system observed a coronal mass ejection (CME) shock arrival at Earth orbit, captured through continuous monitoring of ACE/DSCOVR satellite data.

### Primary Event: HIGH_IMPACT Detection
**Timestamp:** 2025-12-10 21:19:00 UTC

This event triggered HIGH_IMPACT capsule generation based on combined threshold exceedance:
- **Proton Density:** 16.49 cm⁻³ (threshold: ≥ 15 cm⁻³)
- **Bz Component:** -14.35 nT (threshold: ≤ -10 nT)
- **Solar Wind Speed:** 442.3 km/s
- **Temperature:** 28.1 × 10³ K

The simultaneous elevation of proton density and strong southward magnetic field (negative Bz) represents conditions conducive to enhanced geomagnetic activity through magnetic reconnection at Earth's magnetopause.

### Secondary Event: CLUFT_DEVIATION Detection
**Timestamp:** 2025-12-10 22:19:00 UTC

One hour after peak impact, the system detected a CLUFT_DEVIATION condition:
- **Proton Density:** 13.57 cm⁻³ (below HIGH_IMPACT but elevated)
- **Bz Component:** -15.2 nT (EXTREME - strongest observed)
- **X-ray Flux Proxy:** 1.8762 (NO corresponding flare)
- **Solar Wind Speed:** 437.7 km/s (sustained)

This configuration represents a partial match scenario: extremely strong negative Bz without coincident solar flare signature. This condition provides a test case for the CLUFT hypothesis—whether magnetic field structure residuals align with predicted lattice corrections in the absence of X-ray forcing.

## Physical Context

### CME Shock Structure
The observed progression from 18:21 through 22:19 UTC shows classic CME shock arrival:
1. **Pre-shock (18:21-19:19):** Quiet conditions, low density (4.43-8.1 cm⁻³), near-zero Bz
2. **Shock arrival (20:21):** Initial compression, Bz turns negative (-14.41 nT)
3. **Peak impact (21:19):** Maximum density (16.49 cm⁻³), sustained negative Bz
4. **Sustained phase (22:19):** Strongest Bz (-15.2 nT), moderate density

### CLUFT Research Question
The 22:19 UTC observation poses a specific testable question:

**When proton density and Bz are elevated but X-ray flux is absent, does the observed curl residual (Δ) in the magnetic field structure align in direction and magnitude with the predicted lattice correction C_luft = μ₀ α × n̂?**

This question separates solar wind magnetic structure from radiative (X-ray) forcing, allowing isolated testing of the CLUFT lattice correction hypothesis.

## Data Verification

### Source Data
- **File:** `raw_csv/cme_heartbeat_log_2025_12.csv`
- **Records:** 6 time points spanning 25 hours
- **Source:** ACE/DSCOVR real-time solar wind monitoring
- **Cadence:** Variable (58-60 minutes)

### Capsule Generation
Two event capsules automatically generated by v0.7.0 intake harness:
1. **HIGH_IMPACT_capsule_2025-12-10T21-19-00Z.json**
   - Triggered by: density ≥ 15 AND Bz ≤ -10
   - Assessment: Critical geomagnetic impact conditions
   
2. **CLUFT_DEVIATION_capsule_2025-12-10T22-19-00Z.json**
   - Triggered by: Bz ≤ -10 WITHOUT flare correlation
   - Assessment: Test case for lattice correction hypothesis

### Integrity Verification
All data processed through LUFT v0.7.0 intake system:
- SHA-256 hashing on input CSV
- Threshold validation against config_thresholds.json
- Automated capsule generation with ISO 8601 timestamps
- UTC time basis maintained throughout

## Teaching Points

### 1. CME Shock Detection Criteria
Real-time solar wind monitoring enables detection of CME shock arrival through:
- Sudden proton density increase
- Magnetic field magnitude and direction changes
- Solar wind velocity enhancement
- Temperature elevation

### 2. Geomagnetic Impact Assessment
The combination of elevated density and strong southward Bz (negative) is more geoeffective than either parameter alone. Reconnection efficiency scales with both plasma density and magnetic field magnitude when Bz < 0.

### 3. Research Hypothesis Testing
The CLUFT_DEVIATION capsule represents a falsifiable test:
- **Hypothesis:** Magnetic field residuals show lattice correction alignment
- **Null hypothesis:** Residuals are random or follow standard MHD prediction
- **Test:** Compare observed curl residual with C_luft = μ₀ α × n̂
- **Status:** Test harness armed, awaiting field structure analysis

## Academic Standards

This teaching capsule presents:
- **Verified observational data** from NOAA primary sources (ACE/DSCOVR)
- **Standard solar wind parameters** with SI units and conventional notation
- **Automated detection criteria** documented in version-controlled code
- **Falsifiable hypothesis** with specific mathematical prediction
- **No speculative claims** about outcomes prior to analysis

## Next Steps

### For Students
1. Examine the raw CSV data to identify shock arrival signatures
2. Compare 21:19 (HIGH_IMPACT) vs 22:19 (CLUFT_DEVIATION) parameter combinations
3. Consider why strong Bz without flare is scientifically interesting
4. Understand that the CLUFT hypothesis remains **untested** until field analysis completes

### For Researchers
1. Retrieve ACE/DSCOVR magnetic field vector time series for Dec 10 22:00-23:00 UTC
2. Calculate curl residual: Δ = ∇×B_observed - ∇×B_MHD_predicted
3. Calculate predicted CLUFT correction: C_luft = μ₀ α × n̂
4. Compare residual direction and magnitude with prediction
5. Document results in new teaching capsule (#003) regardless of outcome
