# Teaching Capsule 001: Foundation of Verified Truth in Physics

## Capsule Metadata

- **ID:** TC-001
- **Date Created:** 2025-12-11
- **Status:** Active
- **Category:** Foundational Principles

## Core Principle

This capsule establishes the foundational approach for all physics content in this repository: **verified truth only**.

## Key Tenets

### 1. Academic Rigor
All physics and mathematics content must be:
- Approved by current academic standards
- Based on peer-reviewed research
- Supported by experimental evidence
- Reproducible and testable

### 2. No Speculation
We explicitly reject:
- Fictional narratives
- Metaphorical explanations without mathematical backing
- Embellishment of facts
- Unverified claims presented as truth

### 3. Collaborative Learning
This is a classroom where:
- Teachers and students learn together
- Questions are welcomed and explored rigorously
- Knowledge is built incrementally
- Evidence guides understanding

## Application to Repository Structure

### Integration System
The integration system contains:
- **intake-vault**: Verified data intake and validation system
- **lattice-audit**: Audit trail for physics data and calculations
- **teaching-capsules**: Verified teaching artifacts (this document is #1)

### Verification Process
1. All data must pass intake validation
2. Calculations must be auditable through lattice system
3. Teaching content must reference verified sources
4. Changes are logged in WITNESS_LOG.md

## Mathematical Foundation

All physics principles use standard SI units and notation:
- Length: meters (m)
- Mass: kilograms (kg)
- Time: seconds (s)
- Temperature: kelvin (K)
- Energy: joules (J) or electron-volts (eV) where appropriate

- CONTRIBUTING.md
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

## Commitment

By maintaining this teaching capsule system, we commit to:
- Present only verified, academically sound physics
- Document our learning process transparently
- Maintain audit trails for all claims
- Update content as academic consensus evolves
