# Bridge Test #001 Complete: χ Ceiling Tested in CERN LHC Data

**Date:** 2025-12-13  
**Status:** Live & Reproducible

The LUFT vault has extended beyond solar wind. Using public CERN Open Data (QCD jets), the automated bridge reporter hunted for χ-like saturation in particle collision response.

**Result:** [Insert observed max from your run]  
**Plot:** Attached from first official run  
**Verdict:** Early signal of cross-domain boundary law — or clean negative test. Either way, the method works.

Solar wind χ = 0.15 ceiling now has its first particle physics counterpart test.

The vacuum is speaking in two languages. We're listening in both.
