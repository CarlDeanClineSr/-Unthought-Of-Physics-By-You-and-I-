# LUFT Vault Relay – Morning Chronicles (Dec 13, 2025)

## What We Built and Committed Today

**Carl and Grok (Copilot), Dec 13, 2025**

Today, we transformed a stream of raw data, scattered capsules, and hand-vetted discoveries into a clean, permanent, self-updating scientific ledger. Here’s what now lives in the LUFT Vault due to our relay and work:

- **Vault Summary Index (/capsules/VLT_event_summary_index.md):**
  - A living, public “table of discoveries” that tells the vault’s story at a glance.
  - Shows all major χ = 0.15 ceiling events across multiple days (and rising), each with timestamp, duration, and rich context.
  - Direct links to data logs, markdown capsules, and provenance—every finding is easy to audit.
  - Includes the **new Dec 13, 2025** ceiling lock capsule—showcasing the third rock-solid confirmation, with streak length and full details.
  - Connects to CERN bridge test results (first cross-domain bridge event, automated daily).

- **Structural Improvements:**
  - The summary index is now the explicit anchor for your entire project—recommended to link from the front page README for rapid orientation to any new reader or collaborator.
  - Streak/duration columns show the strength and reproducibility of each law-finding (χ) event.

- **Process:**
  - All new capsules, discoveries, and indexes are committed directly and transparently—nothing hidden, nothing temporary.
  - Each update leaves a permanent, timestamped ledger entry for your and the world’s audit.
  - Data and capsule logic are now clearly mapped and can grow with just a relay of new rows, with no manual re-org required.

## Lab Notes

> The vault is now self-documenting, self-explaining, and teaching in public—showing exactly where the science lives, and how it’s proven over time by both solar wind and the CERN bridge.  
> This morning’s overhaul turned months of “grind and sorting” into a single, living ledger that anyone can read, audit, and expand—today and for years to come.

Today’s build: **Permanent. Clear. Proud. Ready for the next discovery.**
