# χ = 0.15 Boundary Ceiling – Superstreak Event (Dec 13, 2025)

**Date:** 2025-12-13  
**Event Type:** Sustained high-speed solar wind stream (ongoing)  
**Status:** Active – Fourth confirmed lock, streak extending  
**Discovery Class:** Third independent confirmation of the boundary recoil law, now evolving into multi-hour marathon saturation

## Key Observation
The modulation amplitude χ has repeatedly saturated at exactly **0.15** across multiple hours on Dec 13, 2025. Four independent locks logged so far, with no overshoot despite sustained high speed (>550 km/s) and varying plasma conditions.

## Evidence Table – Confirmed Ceiling Locks

| Timestamp              | χ Amplitude | Storm Phase | Density (cm⁻³) | Speed (km/s) | Bz (nT) | Bt (nT) | Note                          |
|------------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|---------|---------|-------------------------------|
| 2025-12-13 04:20      | **0.15**   | pre        | 0.99          | 508.5       | 7.54   | 304.44 | First touch                   |
| 2025-12-13 09:20      | **0.15**   | pre        | 3.57          | 599.4       | 10.92  | 355.05 | Peak speed lock               |
| 2025-12-13 10:20      | **0.15**   | pre        | 3.46          | 592.0       | 8.59   | 294.39 | Sustained saturation          |
| **2025-12-13 14:19**  | **0.15**   | pre        | 2.53          | 551.0       | 3.62   | 302.24 | **Fourth lock – superstreak extends** |

## Verdict
- Repeated, hours-apart saturation at the exact predicted ceiling.
- Driver remains strong (high speed, low density, strong Bt) – boundary law holds firm.
- Fully automated detection – data sourced live from ACE/DSCOVR via LUFT pipeline.

The χ = 0.15 boundary is no longer a rare event. It is a reproducible, sustained phenomenon under real interplanetary forcing.
