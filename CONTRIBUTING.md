# Contributing Guidelines

## Welcome to Our Classroom

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this collaborative learning space. This repository operates as a classroom where we learn together, with clear guidelines to maintain academic rigor.

## Core Principles

### 1. Real Science Only
- All contributions must be based on **academically approved mathematics and physics**
- Citations to peer-reviewed sources are strongly encouraged
- Current academic standards must be followed (as they evolve day by day)

### 2. No Fiction, Metaphors, or Embellishing
- Present concepts with clarity and precision
- Avoid metaphorical language that obscures scientific accuracy
- Use technical terms appropriately and define them when necessary
- No speculative claims without proper evidence

### 3. Learning Together
- We are all students and teachers
- Ask questions freely and respectfully
- Share knowledge generously
- Admit when you don't understand something - this is how we learn

## How to Contribute

### Before You Begin
1. Ensure your contribution aligns with academic standards
2. Verify any mathematical or physical claims with reliable sources
3. Prepare clear, factual explanations without embellishment

### Contribution Types

#### Physics Concepts
- Document established physics principles
- Identify areas that may benefit from updated approaches
- Provide clear mathematical derivations
- Include references to academic sources

#### Mathematical Frameworks
- Present approved mathematical methods
- Show step-by-step derivations
- Explain applications to physics problems
- Maintain mathematical rigor

#### Learning Resources
- Share curated academic resources
- Link to peer-reviewed papers

- Verify accuracy before sharing

### Submission Process
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a descriptive branch name
3. Make your changes following our guidelines
4. Include references and citations
5. Submit a pull request with a clear description
6. Be open to peer review and discussion

## Quality Standards

### Content Must:
- Be factually accurate
- Follow current academic standards
- Include proper citations where applicable
- Use clear, precise language
- Be free of speculation presented as fact

### Content Must Not:
- Include unverified claims
- Use metaphors in place of clear explanation
- Embellish for dramatic effect
- Present fiction or speculation as established science
- Deviate from approved academic methods without justification

## Review Process

All contributions are reviewed by the community. During review:
- Questions may be asked for clarification
