# Physics Topics

This directory contains organized studies of specific physics topics. Each topic should:

- Be based on academically approved physics principles
- Include proper mathematical derivations
- Cite reliable sources
- Present information clearly without metaphor or embellishment

## Organization

Topics are organized by physics domain. Suggested structure:

- `mechanics/` - Classical mechanics, Newtonian physics
- `thermodynamics/` - Heat, energy, entropy
- `electromagnetism/` - Electric and magnetic fields, Maxwell's equations
- `quantum/` - Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory
- `relativity/` - Special and general relativity
- `astrophysics/` - Celestial mechanics, cosmology
- `statistical/` - Statistical mechanics

## Guidelines for Topic Files

Each topic file should include:
1. Clear statement of the physical principle
2. Mathematical formulation with proper notation
3. Derivations (when appropriate)
4. References to academic sources
5. Known limitations or areas of ongoing research

Remember: Real science only. No speculation presented as fact.
